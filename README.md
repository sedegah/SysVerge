# SysVerge â€“ System Analyzer in Java

**SysVerge** is a lightweight Java-based system analyzer that gathers and displays real-time system information using the [OSHI](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) (Operating System and Hardware Information) library. It reports details such as CPU usage, memory statistics, disk usage, and system uptime.

---

## Features

* CPU and processor information
* Total and available memory
* Disk space usage
* System boot time and uptime
* Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or newer
* Maven 3.x
